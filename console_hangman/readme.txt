The game is very simple. Guess the word before the hangman is tied from the noose!

Requirements:
- The secret word must be provided as a command line argument. This is something we may improve upon later. 
ex: `python3 main.py awesome` 

- The user will have only 6 incorrect guesses. 

- Every turn should prompt the user with an ASCII graphical display of the hangman and a string of characters to illustrate the secret word.

- The game must end with either a successful or failure message.
