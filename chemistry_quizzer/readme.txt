Students in Mr. Arun's chemistry class are required to know the periodic table by heart. 

Requirements:
1.  Craft a program that asks students questions to help them study.
    Start by asking them to name the element associated with a particular atomic number.

2. What if we now did the opposite and prompted them to provide the atomic number given an element?

3. Implement logic to craft questions that may prompt with any of the four details and ask for any of the other three.

4. Randomly rapid fire the questions. 

5. Gameify the process: Introduce a timer so that students can see how many questions they can answer before the time limit runs out.
